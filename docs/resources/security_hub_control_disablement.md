  Disables a Security Hub control in the configured region.
  It can be useful to turn off security checks for controls that are not relevant to your environment. For example, you
  might use a single Amazon S3 bucket to log your CloudTrail logs. If so, you can turn off controls related to CloudTrail
  logging in all accounts and Regions except for the account and Region where the centralized S3 bucket is located.
  Disabling irrelevant controls reduces the number of irrelevant findings. It also removes the failed check from the
  readiness score for the associated standard.

# awsutils_security_hub_control_disablement (Resource)

Disables a Security Hub control in the configured region.

It can be useful to turn off security checks for controls that are not relevant to your environment. For example, you 
might use a single Amazon S3 bucket to log your CloudTrail logs. If so, you can turn off controls related to CloudTrail 
logging in all accounts and Regions except for the account and Region where the centralized S3 bucket is located. 
Disabling irrelevant controls reduces the number of irrelevant findings. It also removes the failed check from the 
readiness score for the associated standard.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    awsutils = {
      source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
      # For local development,
      # install the provider on local computer by running `make install` from the root of the repo, and uncomment the 
      # version below
      # version = "9999.99.99"
    }
  }
}

provider "awsutils" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "awsutils_security_hub_control_disablement" "default" {
  control_arn = "arn:aws:securityhub:${data.aws_region.this.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id}:control/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/v/1.2.0/1.1"
  reason      = "Global Resources are not evaluated in this region"
}

data "aws_region" "this" {}
